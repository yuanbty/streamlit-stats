# Stats Playground (Streamlit)

A simple Streamlit dashboard demonstrating:
1) Central Limit Theorem (CLT) via simulation of sample means  
2) Confidence interval (CI) coverage for the mean under repeated sampling  
3) Beta distribution intuition for probability uncertainty (common in A/B testing)

## Run locally
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
